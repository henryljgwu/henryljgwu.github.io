Tokenization is crucial in transformer models, particularly in LLMs. With various tokenizers available, determining the best one requires thorough discussion and validation. By examining and visualizing the attention matrix in LLMs, we can gain insights into how different tokenizers impact model performance.

## Proposal
Tokenizers are an important part of transformers, especially in LLMs. However, various tokenizers have been established, and which is better remains a topic of discussion and validation. By examining the attention matrix in LLMs and visualizing it, we might gain insight into how the tokenizer affects the model's performance.

## Idea
LLMs are capable of handling multiple tasks. For this study, we will focus on inference, memory retention, and summarization.

## Methodology

# Visualize
We will start by visualizing the attention matrices of LLMs when using different tokenizers. This will involve:
- Plotting attention weights across different layers and heads.
- Comparing these visualizations to understand the influence of tokenizers on attention distribution.

# Dataset
To ensure a comprehensive analysis, we will use a diverse dataset that includes:
- Texts from various domains (e.g., literature, scientific articles, news).
- A mix of languages and dialects to test the robustness of tokenizers across different linguistic structures.

# Model Training and Setup
The steps for model training and setup include:
- Selecting and pre-processing the dataset for training.
- Configuring the LLM with different tokenizer settings.
- Training the model using established training protocols.
- Evaluating the model's performance on the selected tasks (inference, memory retention, summarization) using standard benchmarks.
<!--
By following this methodology, we aim to provide a detailed comparative analysis of various tokenizers and their effects on LLM performance, leading to more informed choices in model design and application.
