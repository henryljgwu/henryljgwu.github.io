## 1. Introduction

The evaluation of large language models (LLMs) has become increasingly critical as their applications continue to expand across various domains. Traditional benchmarks for LLMs, such as GLUE, SuperGLUE, and others, often focus on specific tasks or datasets, which may not fully capture the diverse capabilities of these models. Recent advancements in LLMs, particularly with the introduction of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and the development of LLM agents, present new opportunities for evaluating these models in a more holistic and comprehensive manner.

## 2. Background

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines the strengths of information retrieval and generative modeling, allowing LLMs to access external knowledge bases to generate more accurate and contextually relevant responses. This approach has shown promise in improving the performance of LLMs across various tasks, including question answering, summarization, and dialogue generation.

LLM agents, on the other hand, represent a more autonomous and interactive approach to utilizing LLMs. These agents are capable of performing complex tasks by interacting with multiple modalities and knowledge sources, often requiring a deep understanding of context and the ability to generate coherent responses across diverse input types.

## 3. Problem Statement

Given the rapid advancements in LLM capabilities, there is a pressing need to explore whether RAG and LLM agents can be utilized as evaluation methods or benchmarks for assessing LLMs themselves. The primary question this research seeks to answer is: Can RAG and LLM agents serve as effective evaluation methods for LLM benchmarks, and if so, how can they be integrated into existing evaluation frameworks?

## 4. Proposed Methodology

# 1. Current State-of-the-Art RAG and Agent Methods

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):**

- **RAG by Facebook AI (2020)**: RAG is an architecture that combines retrieval and generation to improve the quality of responses generated by LLMs. It uses a dense passage retrieval (DPR) model to fetch relevant documents and then a sequence-to-sequence model (like BART or T5) to generate the final output using both the retrieved documents and the query.

- **REALM by Google Research (2020)**: REALM (Retrieval-Augmented Language Model Pre-training) integrates retrieval mechanisms into the pre-training process of a language model. This allows the model to leverage external knowledge during inference, making it more informed and contextually aware.

**LLM Agents:**

- **ReAct by Princeton University (2022)**: ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) introduces an agent-like approach where LLMs perform actions based on reasoning. The method integrates reasoning steps and decision-making into the model's output, enabling the LLM to interact with its environment more effectively.

- **Toolformer by Meta AI (2023)**: Toolformer is a method where LLMs are trained to use external tools and APIs to perform complex tasks. The model learns when and how to invoke these tools, effectively becoming an agent capable of more than just text generation.

# 2. Integrating RAG and Agent Methods

To combine RAG and agent methods effectively, we can design a system where an LLM agent uses RAG as a core mechanism for knowledge retrieval during its reasoning and decision-making processes. Here's how they can be organically integrated:

1. **Knowledge Retrieval**: The LLM agent uses RAG to retrieve relevant information from a vast corpus. This retrieval step ensures that the agent is well-informed and has access to the most relevant knowledge for the task.

2. **Reasoning and Acting**: After retrieving information, the agent uses this knowledge to reason through the task. For example, in a decision-making process, the agent can weigh different pieces of retrieved information to arrive at a conclusion.

3. **Multi-modal Integration**: If the task involves multi-modal inputs (e.g., text, images, or tables), the agent can combine RAG's retrieval capabilities with its multi-modal understanding, enabling it to process and generate responses that account for various types of data.

4. **Interactive Workflow**: The agent can perform iterative interactions, where it retrieves additional information or consults external tools (as in Toolformer) to refine its understanding and output. This loop continues until the agent reaches a satisfactory conclusion.

# 3. Designing Evaluation Methods for Financial and Medical Datasets

**Financial Domain:**

- **Dataset**: A financial dataset might include market reports, historical stock prices, economic indicators, and financial news articles.
- **Evaluation Process**:
  1. **Task Definition**: Define tasks like predicting stock price movements, analyzing market sentiment, or generating financial reports based on historical data and news.
  2. **RAG Retrieval**: The agent retrieves relevant financial documents, reports, or historical data using a RAG model tailored to financial terminology.
  3. **Reasoning**: The agent analyzes the retrieved data to generate predictions or summaries, considering multi-modal inputs like financial charts or tables.
  4. **Decision Making**: The agent makes investment recommendations or forecasts, which are compared against actual outcomes or expert analyses.

**Medical Domain:**

- **Dataset**: A medical dataset might include clinical trials, patient records, medical imaging, and research articles.
- **Evaluation Process**:
  1. **Task Definition**: Define tasks like diagnosing diseases, suggesting treatment plans, or summarizing medical research based on patient data and literature.
  2. **RAG Retrieval**: The agent retrieves relevant clinical studies, patient records, and imaging data using a RAG model tuned to medical jargon.
  3. **Reasoning**: The agent processes the retrieved information, integrating insights from various medical modalities (text, images, lab results) to formulate a diagnosis or treatment plan.
  4. **Decision Making**: The agent provides a diagnosis or treatment recommendation, which is evaluated against expert decisions or established medical guidelines.

# 4.4. Quantifying Evaluation Metrics

To evaluate the performance of the RAG+agent system, we need to establish metrics that compare its output with human experts or existing benchmarks:

1. **Accuracy**: Measure the correctness of the agent's predictions or recommendations against a ground truth (e.g., actual market outcomes, patient diagnoses).

2. **Coherence**: Assess the logical consistency and flow of the generated content, particularly in multi-step reasoning tasks.

3. **Contextual Understanding**: Evaluate how well the agent understands and utilizes context, especially in multi-modal scenarios (e.g., how well it integrates text with images or tables).

4. **Efficiency**: Measure the time and computational resources required to arrive at a conclusion. Efficient models that perform well with fewer resources are preferred.

5. **Human-Expert Comparison**: Conduct blind tests where human experts assess the quality of the agent's output without knowing whether it was generated by a machine or another human. Compare these assessments to established SOTA benchmarks.

6. **Task-Specific Metrics**: For domain-specific tasks, use relevant metrics such as F1 score for medical diagnosis or Sharpe ratio for financial predictions.

7. **Benchmark Gap Analysis**: Quantify the difference in performance between the RAG+agent method and SOTA benchmarks by comparing the above metrics across a diverse set of tasks. This can include statistical significance tests to determine if the differences are meaningful.
